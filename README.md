# distance_counter
distance_counter for SWE Level 5

# Usage
- Clone the repo
- Create a virtual environment
- Install requirements.txt
- from /distance_counter/distance_counter run `python manage.py runserver`

This will run the page from http://127.0.0.1:8000 which will return an error.
The 'homepage' is currently as above with /distance added to the end, so http://127.0.0.1:8000/distance

Alternatively use http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin for the Admin View

Login page works, and new users can register themselves.
Database created and ready to be populated.
Still looks awful.
